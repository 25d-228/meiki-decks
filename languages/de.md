# German: sentence and card authoring guide

**Production locale:** `de-DE`  
**Scope:** A1–C2-oriented German with a separate DACH recognition and domain-specialization layer.

## 1. Purpose and required deliverables

**Fixed deliverable: 8 stages; 8,700 accepted sentence cards.** The exact stage schedule is defined in [Section 4.1](#fixed-stages).

Write original, natural **full sentences with one focused typed-cloze target**, not a personal study timetable. Each accepted record must teach a defined word, sense, grammatical distinction, or compact construction in a recoverable situation.

The finished card shows the sentence with that span hidden, provides typed input and the **full-sentence recording on the front**, and reveals the sentence, answer, concise support, and replay on the back. One source record yields one cloze card; do not multiply counts through unrequested reverse or alternate-mode cards.

Deliver sentence records, synchronized coverage mappings, and editorial evidence. **Complete and accept all text for all nine project languages before producing any audio.** For this language, finish every planned sentence, cloze, answer, annotation, reading, and coverage mapping, then complete editorial review, corrections, and source checks. Acceptance of this language's text permits the next language's text work, not audio generation. The pronunciation sections describe written sentence/reading requirements and the subsequent audio phase; no representative recordings, auditions, synthesis tests, or denoising runs belong to the text phase. This guide defines authoring scope; it does not certify a learner’s proficiency.

## 2. Production model, script, and register

Use **educated contemporary Standard German as used in Germany (`de-DE`)** for production. This is the project selection within the guide’s Germany/Austria/Switzerland options. Keep spelling, pronunciation, ordinary vocabulary, and social conventions coherent.

From B1-oriented work onward, plan labeled recognition of Austrian and Swiss Standard German and relevant northern, central, or southern usage. Swiss Standard German is not interchangeable with Swiss German dialect comprehension. Do not assemble a synthetic production model from several standards or introduce a dialect as neutral German.

---

## 3. Curriculum framework and limits of card evidence

Preserve **Goethe-Zertifikat A1 → A2 → B1 → B2 → C1 → C2** as the guide’s general reference route. **TestDaF** is a separate B2–C1-oriented academic-admission route, not another name for the whole progression. Foundation supports A1; near-native domain use is distinct from a C2 result. Sentence guides do not establish current test specifications or official vocabulary totals.

---

## 4. Prerequisites and whole-language coverage

Messages written by the person may be headed simply **HUMAN**. Treat them as HUMAN instructions for the receiving agent; a recipient suffix is unnecessary. Keep both agents’ HUMAN-facing messages and forwarded handoffs short, and keep plans/issues specific and detailed.

After HUMAN approves starting, ORCHESTRATOR first publishes all nine supplied authoring guides together to the repository's `main` branch under `languages/`, preserving their contents. This reference-only publication precedes writing plan issues. ORCHESTRATOR then writes **one roadmap issue and nine language-plan issues—one per language, ten planning issues in total**—using the committed guides as references. Each language-plan issue links to its guide at the recorded commit and relevant headings. Complete every language's all-stage text plan and later audio/bundle plan before the first executor generation handoff.

For this language, its own language-plan issue must preserve the exact stage IDs, names, card counts, and total in Section 4.1, as well as the complete milestone inventories, sentence/cloze requirements, support fields, prerequisites, scope boundaries, and completion criteria for every stage. Do not use issue writing to select a shorter curriculum or reduce production quantities. A stage title or ‘details later’ is not enough. The roadmap links the nine plans and tracks project order; it does not replace their detailed specifications. The executor follows the assigned execution issue, the already-written language-plan section, and the pinned repository guide, then adds actual card IDs to its coverage inventory as work proceeds. Execution issues are bounded assignments created when needed, not substitutes for the complete upfront plans. For each objective, identify the prior language needed to understand the visible context; do not make every difficult word a new target at once, depend silently on a later stage, or count visible exposure as taught retrieval.

Use a small coverage table outside learner records:

| Inventory item | Required information |
|---|---|
| Identity | Stable objective ID and the relevant guide subsection |
| Learning point | Exact sense, form, construction, or pragmatic distinction |
| Context | Situation, register, production/recognition role, and necessary participants |
| Prerequisites | Earlier targets needed for the sentence and its interpretation |
| Evidence | Authored card IDs, review result, and any unresolved requirement |

Count cards, lemmas, senses, constructions, and incidental exposure separately; add script-specific measures where the language requires them. **The fixed production schedule below defines the exact stage counts and total.** Coverage planning must fill that schedule with the guide’s complete teachable scope, not recalculate a smaller collection from a short selection. A matching card total alone does not prove lexical breadth or proficiency; track those claims separately.

<a id="fixed-stages"></a>

### 4.1. Fixed production stages and exact card counts

Create **8 stages and exactly 8,700 accepted cards** for German, in the order below. These are deliverable counts, not ranges, caps, optional targets, or a sampled “core” collection. Each card is one original sentence record with one focused cloze; do not count annotations, incidental words, alternate answers, audio files, or reverse cards as additional cards.

**Allocation basis:** A dedicated foundation preserves sound–spelling and sentence-frame work. Subsequent allocations expand noun/government networks, case and adjective contrasts, clause architecture, lexical compounds, register, and DACH recognition; separate C2 and domain stages retain rhetorical and socially situated depth.

**Status of the numbers:** the counts and stage splits are project authoring allocations. They are not quantities prescribed by the source’s examination bodies, guarantees of proficiency, an exhaustive dictionary, or measured optimal learning loads. HUMAN’s approval to start production adopts this written schedule; the agents do not choose different counts while writing issues.

| Stage | Fixed deck display name | Required guide coverage | Exact cards | Batches (up to 40 cards) | Cumulative cards |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `00` | German 00 — Sound, spelling, and sentence foundations | Sections 6.1 | 200 | 5 | 200 |
| `01` | German 01 — A1 basic communication | Sections 6.2 | 600 | 15 | 800 |
| `02` | German 02 — A2 routine communication | Sections 6.3 | 900 | 23 (22 × 40 + 20) | 1,700 |
| `03` | German 03 — B1 independent communication | Sections 6.4 | 1,200 | 30 | 2,900 |
| `04` | German 04 — B2 extended communication | Sections 6.5 | 1,400 | 35 | 4,300 |
| `05` | German 05 — C1 precise communication | Sections 6.6 | 1,600 | 40 | 5,900 |
| `06` | German 06 — C2 precision, rhetoric, and mediation | Sections 6.7 | 1,800 | 45 | 7,700 |
| `07` | German 07 — Social, professional, and cultural depth | Sections 6.8 | 1,000 | 25 | 8,700 |
| **Total** | **8 stages** | **All eight milestone inventories, plus cross-cutting requirements** | **8,700** | **218** | **8,700** |

Use source IDs `de-<stage>-0001` through `de-<stage>-NNNN`, where `NNNN` is that stage’s exact count, zero-padded to four digits. Use `cards/<locale>/<stage>.json` and `coverage/<locale>/<stage>.md`; the production locale is `de-DE`. Deck IDs are `deck:<locale>:<stage>`. Within-stage ordering is intentional. Every stage depends on the preceding stages of this language, not on knowledge of another project language.

The batch column uses 40-card batches plus a smaller final batch when needed; a parenthesized expression shows that split. Never round a stage count up to fill a batch or down to omit the remainder. Batch size is an execution arrangement, not a requirement for 40 cards per learning point or topic. A different approved batch split must still sum to the same stage count and must not introduce per-batch commits or full test runs.

#### Required distribution across stages

- **Stage 00:** Cover useful sound–spelling contrasts, stress, basic V2 and bracket frames, articles, negation, questions, modals, and separable components.
- **Stage 01:** Cover noun packages, nominative/accusative, pronouns, present/modal/separable verbs, imperative, early dative and perfect uses, and everyday transactions.
- **Stage 02:** Cover dative, location/destination, perfect and common preterites, reflexives, comparison, adjective forms, relatives, subordinate/infinitive clauses, and government.
- **Stage 03:** Cover case/government breadth, adjective systems, relatives, passive, narrative preterite, Konjunktiv II, da/wo compounds, connectors, information order, and modal particles.
- **Stage 04:** Develop extended phrases, participial and infinitive structures, reported speech, past hypotheses, noun–verb collocations, nominal/verbal style, register, and DACH recognition.
- **Stage 05:** Cover source synthesis, stance, advanced collocations, precise clause architecture, academic/professional language, mitigation, register shifts, and region-aware comprehension.
- **Stage 06:** Cover idioms, argument reconstruction, literature/rhetoric, humor and implication, diplomatic/adversarial language, editing, and register-sensitive interpretation.
- **Stage 07:** Cover distinct community and domain senses, relationships, responsibilities, negotiations, cultural discussion, and broad labeled DACH recognition.

#### Preserve counts and substantive coverage when writing issues

Copy this complete stage table and total into the language-plan issue. Build a detailed coverage allocation under each stage: reference every substantive milestone/system requirement, state the hidden distinction or lexical family, identify contexts and prerequisites, and allocate an exact number of card slots to each authoring block. Block totals must equal the stage count, and stage totals must equal the language total. Blocks may span several batches and have unequal sizes. A card slot has one primary learning point; overlapping secondary coverage does not make it count twice.

**Do not make a compact selection of learning points.** Do not replace the full inventory with a short representative list, a “minimum viable” curriculum, the easiest grammar forms, a handful of umbrella headings, or only the most convenient vocabulary. Concise HUMAN messages, focused clozes, and minimal tooling do not imply reduced curriculum coverage. Preserve lexical senses, constructions, contrast sets, collocations, meaningful inflectional uses, register, recognition-only distinctions, and ordinary/social/professional/cultural range. An item left visible is not thereby taught as the hidden retrieval target.

Multiple cards may develop one important expression through genuinely different senses, complement patterns, grammatical choices, collocations, registers, or communicative functions. Do not require global answer-string uniqueness. Do not fill a fixed count with cosmetic name/noun substitutions, redundant sentences, extra-long blanks, arbitrary conjugation tables, or multiple unrequested card modes.

**Neither agent may reduce, merge, omit, transfer, or redefine a stage’s count without an explicit HUMAN-approved amendment to this guide.** An early claim that coverage is “already sufficient,” low model output, review deletions, context limits, execution time, or fewer chosen learning points does not change the requirement. Repair or replace rejected cards within the same IDs and scope; do not submit an undersized stage as complete. If a genuine coverage/count conflict remains, record the specific gap and proposed adjustment, preserve accepted work, and request only the necessary HUMAN decision rather than padding, silently increasing, or silently reducing counts.

Only count a stage as accepted when both conditions hold: **its exact accepted-card count is met and its complete allocated coverage passes review**. Reconcile this once at stage completion using ordinary source checks and coverage tables; do not build a separate quota service or repeat the whole check after every batch.

### 4.2. Language-specific prerequisite checks

Do not assume Dutch, another Germanic language, or English cognates establish German gender, government, endings, or syntax. Map case selection, noun gender/plural, clause frame, and sound separately. A familiar-looking compound may have a lexicalized meaning; check it before assigning coverage credit.

Make verb-second order and useful noun phrases available early. Do not require isolated mastery of every declension table before meaningful sentences, and do not use unrestricted advanced noun phrases as incidental A1 support.

---

## 5. Essential systems to represent in sentences

### Nouns and government
Teach nouns with gender, plural, a useful case frame, and collocation. Add an unpredictable genitive singular when needed. The source’s **der Tisch — die Tische**, **am Tisch sitzen**, **auf den Tisch legen**, and **den Tisch decken** illustrate different lexical and grammatical uses, not four automatic cards for every noun.

Cover government such as **mit + dative**, **für + accusative**, **jemandem helfen**, **warten auf + accusative**, **sich erinnern an + accusative**, **teilnehmen an + dative**, **abhängig von + dative**, **stolz auf + accusative**, **jemanden um etwas bitten**, and **jemandem etwas erklären**. For two-way prepositions, distinguish location from destination; do not teach “movement means accusative.”

### Clause architecture
Build German sentences directly around the frame: main-clause verb second, verb-first questions/commands, the sentence bracket, and verb-final subordinate clauses. Distinguish coordinating **und/aber/oder/denn**, first-field **deshalb/trotzdem/dann**, and subordinating **weil/obwohl/wenn/dass**. The middle field carries information structure; it is not an English sentence with a verb moved afterward.

### Separable verbs and compounds
Record infinitive, separation, participle, and relevant stress. Contrast the source’s **UMfahren/umFAHren** senses only after verification in an actual context; do not apply the pattern indiscriminately. For **Antrag**, select useful **stellen/bearbeiten/ablehnen**, compound, and nominalization uses with their real meaning, gender, and register.

### Spoken and written language
Cover reductions, contractions **zum/zur/im/am/ins**, weak forms, linking, particles **doch/mal/ja/halt/eben/denn**, reformulation, and register. Modal-particle meanings need an interpretable conversational situation, not a permanent English-equivalent label.

---

## 6. Milestone curriculum and sentence briefs

These eight headings organize the curriculum content. **The fixed production schedule in Section 4.1 defines the actual stage IDs, names, exact card counts, and mapping to these headings.** Use that mapping without merging or dropping a stage. Where two stages share a milestone, divide its full inventory according to their stated emphases; where foundation is integrated into A1, retain both inventories. Cross-cutting requirements in Sections 5 and 7–13 remain mandatory.

The inventories below retain the source’s language topics. A topic such as long-source synthesis, rapid group discussion, or handwriting must be mapped to its teachable sentence component and its outside-card limitation; do not pretend the card performs the entire task. The **sentence brief**, **hidden target**, and **editorial test** are authoring adaptations. They replace learner promotion tests with checks on the created content.

### 6.1. Foundation

**Focused hidden targets:** An article/case choice, present verb, modal, imperative, es gibt component, or introductory perfect.

**Editorial test:** Use dative and adjective phrases within the stated early scope; do not force every ending equally.

### 6.3. Routine communication

**Curriculum reference:** A2

#### Required language and situation inventory

Include:

- full dative article and pronoun system;
- common accusative and dative prepositions;
- two-way prepositions through location/destination contrasts;

#### Authoring brief

**Sentence contexts:** Recent events, practical problems, requests for solutions, comparisons, and connected messages.

**Focused hidden targets:** Dative, location/destination contrast, perfect/preterite component, reflexive form, adjective ending, or clause connector.

**Editorial test:** Check subordinate verb position, the actual governor, and pronoun reference.

### 6.4. Independent communication

**Curriculum reference:** B1

#### Required language and situation inventory

Include:

- nominative, accusative, dative, and common genitive functions;
- adjective endings across frequent article patterns;
- relative clauses in all common cases;

#### Authoring brief

**Sentence contexts:** Narratives, explanations, opinions, formal/informal messages, and practical repair.

**Focused hidden targets:** Genitive/common case use, passive, Konjunktiv II, relative component, da/wo compound, or particle.

**Editorial test:** Keep information order natural and reported-speech recognition distinct from a full productive system.

### 6.5. Upper-intermediate operation

**Curriculum reference:** B2

#### Required language and situation inventory

Include:

- stable case and adjective accuracy under pressure;
- extended noun phrases;
- participial modifiers in reading and formal writing;
- passive alternatives and impersonal constructions;

#### Authoring brief

**Sentence contexts:** General arguments, professional meetings, telephone interaction, source comparisons, and proposals.

**Focused hidden targets:** Nominal/verbal style, a participial component, passive alternative, precise connector, or past hypothetical form.

**Editorial test:** Include written and spoken contexts; a long noun phrase must not become an arbitrary oversized cloze.

### 6.6. Advanced development

**Curriculum reference:** C1

#### Required language and situation inventory

Include:

#### Authoring brief

**Sentence contexts:** Professional and academic sources, qualified disagreement, reformulation, and DACH recognition.

**Focused hidden targets:** A precise collocation, source relation, register shift, or complex-clause component.

**Editorial test:** Keep clarity, attribution, and actual scope; not every advanced sentence should be nominal or bureaucratic.

### 6.7. Proficient integration

**Curriculum reference:** C2

#### Required language and situation inventory

Select the specific advanced distinctions that remain uncovered; do not equate course completion with coverage.

Maintain coverage entries for:

- collocations;
- case and government;
- sentence architecture;
- register;
- modal particles;
- formal nominal style;
- spoken reductions;
- pronunciation and prosody;

#### Authoring brief

**Sentence contexts:** Rhetorical and literary cases, mediation, irony, indirect criticism, adversarial or diplomatic responses, and editing.

**Focused hidden targets:** One focused rhetorical component, lexical distinction, or meaning-preserving repair.

**Editorial test:** The visible situation must support the effect; a card cannot stand in for a full multi-source presentation.

### 6.8. Domain-specific near-native command

**Curriculum reference:** Selected professional, social, and cultural domains

#### Required language and situation inventory

Include:

1. **One professional identity in German.**
2. **One stable social community.**
3. **One target standard variety.**
4. **Broad receptive familiarity with DACH variation.**

Use language situations drawn from:

- working or studying in German;
- recurring group activities;
- friendships maintained principally in German;
- conflict, negotiation, and problem-solving;
- formal and informal messaging;
- literature and long-form journalism;
- comedy and conversational analysis;
- native editorial feedback;
- advanced prosody coaching;
- repeated participation in the same institutions and relationships.

#### Authoring brief

**Sentence contexts:** Responsibilities, relationships, negotiations, cultural references, and region-aware professional communication.

**Focused hidden targets:** A verified domain or pragmatic distinction in the selected German production model.

**Editorial test:** Keep DACH recognition broad but labeled; do not claim dialect or native participation from these recordings.

---

## 7. Pronunciation-aware sentence selection

Choose words and sentences that expose the required sound–form distinction while remaining natural and comprehensible. Record the intended reading, phrase boundary, emphasis, and register when needed for later audio production. A spelling check does not prove pronunciation, and a pronunciation annotation does not prove that audio has been produced.

Keep ordinary written answers separate from phonetic aids. **During the audio phase, after all nine languages' text has been accepted**, validate actual recordings against the exact sentence and investigate omissions, changed words, wrong readings, or inappropriate phrasing. Do not count a fixed-voice sentence set as exhaustive accent or multi-speaker listening coverage.

### Language-specific requirements

Cover long/short and tense/lax vowels, **ü/ö**, **ich-Laut/ach-Laut**, the selected **r**, final devoicing, clusters, stress, glottal onset/phrase boundaries, and reduced **-e/-en/-er**. The source’s **füllen/fühlen, Hölle/Höhle, bitten/bieten, Stadt/Staat, können/kennen** are contrast seeds.

Review prefix and compound stress in context. Keep normal orthography, capitalization, **ä/ö/ü**, and **ß** in the answer; pronunciation support must not silently rewrite them. Audio review must consider vowel quality/length, endings, consonants, stress, and phrase grouping, not one conspicuous sound.

---

## 8. Listening-support sentence composition

Write language that can be understood as an utterance, not a collection of glosses. Use audible grammatical and lexical distinctions in their real phrases. All necessary information must be inside the sentence or a short self-contained exchange; a back-side note cannot invent the missing situation.

The available front recording intentionally contains the answer. The text need not exclude every imaginable synonym, but the canonical target must be natural, correctly spoken, and aligned with the intended learning point. Do not add every plausible synonym as an accepted written variant.

### Language-specific requirements

Select sentences with real verb brackets, weak articles/pronouns, case endings, separable prefixes, discourse particles, and reformulation. A missing inflection in audio can change the target even when the rest of the sentence is understandable. Keep regional recognition separate from the fixed production voice.

---

## 9. Reading, script, and genre in sentences

Select an appropriate sentence genre and reading burden, not an arbitrary maximum length. Beginners need useful phrases with controlled supporting language; advanced cards may need more visible context for scope, stance, or reference. Extra length is justified only by meaning, not as a substitute for a more advanced target.

Do not copy books, transcripts, examination questions, or corpus sentences into the deck. Use references to understand a pattern and write an original situation. A literary or source-comparison card must contain the short evidence it asks the learner to interpret.

### Language-specific requirements

Use original practical messages, narrative, accessible nonfiction, journalism-style arguments, and professional texts. Review the finite verb, bracket, noun-phrase head, case governor, reference, and clause relations. Analyze compounds to help selection, but never assume the meaning is just the sum of the components.

---

## 10. Contrastive cloze design

Specify the intended sense or contrast **before** choosing the blank. Hide one word or a compact useful contiguous construction, leaving the substantive proposition and necessary context visible. A compact fixed utterance can be a justified exception; a long predicate or whole rewritten passage is not.

Distinguish meaningful contrast from padding. Changing only a name, noun, tense, or topic does not automatically create a new learning point. Repeated answer strings are allowed for substantively different senses, frames, or pragmatic functions. Do not enlarge a cloze to make it globally unique.

Keep `answer == cloze`, require one exact occurrence in `sentence`, preserve Unicode grapheme boundaries, and document intentional morphological targets. For a discontinuous construction, hide a learning-bearing component rather than every word between its parts.

### Language-specific requirements

Build useful noun-phrase contrasts across case, number, article, and adjective patterns, and clause contrasts across main/subordinate, modal, and perfect frames. A full ending table is not a sentence curriculum.

For a separable verb or sentence bracket, hide one contiguous learning-bearing component while leaving the other component visible, or choose a naturally contiguous form appropriate to the objective. Do not conceal intervening objects and adverbials merely to put the whole verb in one blank. For case government, retain the governor unless the governor itself is the retrieval target.

---

## 11. Lexical support and authoring records

Record noun gender/plural and relevant genitive irregularity, case government, verb principal behavior, collocations, and register as compact support. Match the grammatical label to the entire hidden span. A determiner-plus-adjective target is not simply “noun.”

The curriculum basis does not provide an exhaustive per-level lexical list. Section 4.1 fixes production counts; develop the noun, government, clause, discourse, and domain inventories within those allocations without narrowing their coverage.


Use UTF-8 JSON arrays in the approved source layout. Required fields are `id`, `sentence`, `cloze`, `answer`, `accepted_answers`, `lemma`, `meaning`, `part_of_speech`, and `audio`. Required text is nonempty; `accepted_answers` is an array, ordinarily empty. `audio` is the logical future path `audio/<id>.mp3`, not proof that media exists.

Useful nonempty optional fields are `reading`, `grammar`, `register`, and `note`. Omit unused fields. The reading and grammatical label must describe the **actual hidden span**. Keep the contextual English meaning concise; use notes for wider frames and restrictions. Do not insert curriculum IDs, review counts, agent instructions, or source bookkeeping into learner annotations.

The following original design example illustrates the record shape; it is not a production card or a fixed syllabus requirement. The `example` ID must not be copied into a production inventory.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "de-example-0001",
    "sentence": "Ich warte vor dem Kino auf meine Schwester.",
    "cloze": "auf",
    "answer": "auf",
    "accepted_answers": [],
    "lemma": "auf",
    "meaning": "for",
    "part_of_speech": "preposition",
    "audio": "audio/de-example-0001.mp3",
    "note": "Warten auf takes an accusative complement; meine Schwester names the person being awaited."
  }
]
```

### Additional sentence-design examples

These illustrate focused spans, not an accepted sentence bank. Apply the same language and source checks to production content.

| Full sentence | Hidden span | Design point |
|---|---|---|
| Das Kind sitzt auf dem Stuhl. | `auf dem Stuhl` | A compact location phrase; distinguish its case function from a destination. |
| Ich rufe dich nach dem Essen an. | `rufe` | The separable component an stays visible; the target does not swallow the intervening sentence. |


---

## 12. Social context and editorial judgment

Where a choice depends on social context, make the relevant speaker, listener, relationship, authority, urgency, and purpose recoverable. Use natural vocatives, a compact situational clause, or a brief attributed exchange rather than English metadata masquerading as spoken target-language text. Do not require an unsupported extra front-side field.

Separate grammar errors, unnatural collocation, unsuitable register, pronunciation problems, and valid regional alternatives. A stylistic preference is not automatically a grammatical ban. If a source claim or an example is uncertain, record the uncertainty and verify it before using that feature in production.

Specify purpose and relationship for **du/Sie**, requests, criticism, workplace small talk, telephone language, and particles. Distinguish neutral spoken language from a formal written formulation. A merely possible German sentence is not automatically idiomatic for that setting.

---

## 13. Writing and editing requirements

Author directly in the target language using the approved content process. A learner exercise that prohibits generated prose is **not** a ban on the executor’s assigned sentence-authoring work. Do not translate one shared list across nine languages.

For editing cards, write a short original source situation and a meaning-preserving repair. Hide the repaired word or compact construction rather than the entire revised sentence. Preserve actor, beneficiary, timeline, number, comparison, source attribution, uncertainty, and commitment unless the visible task explicitly changes them. Do not present invented statements as quotations from real people, research, or news.

Check gender, case, adjective endings, verb placement, tense/mood, government, word choice, collocation, register, punctuation, and English-shaped information order. In source summaries, preserve who asserts a claim and its degree of certainty. In concision tasks, do not remove a material modifier or turn a limited claim into a universal one.

---

## 14. Content acceptance and coverage reconciliation

Acceptance concerns the **cards**, not a learner’s speaking or examination result.

| Review area | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Fixed counts | Every stage has exactly the count and ID range in Section 4.1; stage allocations sum to the language total. Repair or replace rejected cards rather than reducing the deliverable. |
| Coverage | Every approved objective maps to actual hidden learning; omissions, redundancy, and recognition-only scope are reconciled across the language. |
| Sentence | Original, natural, self-contained, suitable for the milestone, with correct reference and social setting. |
| Cloze | Focused, useful, exactly aligned with the answer, and not an arbitrary substring or oversized proposition. |
| Support | Correct contextual meaning, lemma, whole-span label, and any reading/register/grammar note. |
| Progression | Visible prerequisites are available; repeated forms add a defensible distinction. |
| Technical integrity | Unique IDs/sentences, normalization, language-appropriate spelling/punctuation, valid fields, and declared audio paths. |
| Audio phase, after all nine text sets are accepted | Actual sentence/recording agreement and review of relevant pronunciation; no audio production or claims of verified recordings during the text phase. |

Every agent launched by the executor must use **Sol 6.1**, including authors, editors, final auditors, and any other permitted child agents. Keep the orchestrator prompt’s high reasoning effort, sequential ephemeral execution, read-only sandbox, structured JSON output, and no nested agents or child repository edits. Use the exact Sol 6.1 CLI identifier established once for the authorized environment; do not guess it or silently substitute another model.

Use a fresh author and separate editor for each manageable batch, ordinarily around 40 records, without treating batch size as a topic quota. Save accepted records and mappings as work proceeds, using only lightweight new/changed-record checks during ingestion. After authoring the stage, perform one final editorial pass in consecutive partitions covering every record and mapping, ordinarily no more than 400 records per partition. Apply verified findings together, check the affected records, and run one consolidated final source/coverage check. The orchestrator reviews the submitted changes and evidence; a narrow correction does not require rewriting or reauditing unchanged material.

Normally make **one implementation commit and one push per completed stage**, plus one correction commit/push per requested review round. Do not commit per batch, editor response, audit partition, or progress update. Save progress in normal files and temporary material under local `/tmp`; make a recovery commit only for a concrete interruption or risk, not on a fixed schedule. Use focused local tests when implementation changes and normal CI for the full suite. Do not run the complete repository checks repeatedly during authoring, duplicate valid CI locally, or add prompt/review/checkpoint infrastructure. Follow the orchestrator specification's detailed commit and check cadence; retain required content reviews and final integrity checks.

Keep concise counts, reviewed ID ranges, verified corrections, source hashes, and unresolved requirements in the PR. Reconcile this language's complete coverage before accepting its text; passing each stage’s self-written checklist alone is not sufficient. The orchestrator confirms accepted text and coverage for **all nine languages** before assigning any audio or bundle work. Text acceptance does not require recordings, audio-runtime access, or an installable archive. Activities such as sustained conversation, handwriting, long-form writing, live mediation, and community participation remain outside-card outcomes, not missing tests to invent inside the card app.

## 15. References by authoring purpose

The following reference roles and links come from the supplied language curriculum. They are **not newly checked claims of availability, editions, examination rules, or approval for copying content**. Inspect the relevant material before using it to support a disputed language decision. Do not require purchases, account creation, new tools, or downloads merely because a resource is named.

Use curriculum references for scope, dictionaries/grammars for forms and usage, spoken material for register and pronunciation, and examination references for task boundaries. Cite material decisions in production evidence. Reading a reference does not authorize reproducing its exercises, recorded voices, or sentence collection.

Use **Netzwerk neu → Aspekte neu**, or **Schritte international Neu → Kontext**, as alternative source-listed scope routes. **Grammatik aktiv**, **Phonothek intensiv**, Goethe/DW materials, PONS/Langenscheidt, Duden/DWDS, Easy German, Nachrichtenleicht, ARD/Deutschlandfunk/ARTE, and examination references supply distinct kinds of evidence. Do not turn their exercise sequences into copied sentences.

## 16. Card failure modes and repairs

| Reject or investigate | Required repair |
|---|---|
| Bare noun without gender or plural support | Supply the useful lexical package. |
| Movement automatically selects accusative | Check location/destination and the actual construction. |
| Discontinuous verb hidden with all intervening words | Retarget one meaningful contiguous component. |
| V2 or final verb is patched onto translated English | Write from the German clause frame. |
| Modal particles glossed as permanent word equations | Provide discourse and relationship context. |
| DACH forms mixed into one production standard | Label recognition and keep de-DE conventions coherent. |
| A copied sentence, translation list, or mechanical substitution grid | Write an original situation with a defensible hidden learning point. |
| A whole proposition or several independent targets are hidden | Retarget one useful unit and keep the necessary context visible. |
| The source does not establish a claimed rule or level inventory | Record the gap and verify the claim before using it; distinguish proposed additions. |

## 17. Basis, adaptations, and unresolved scope

**Content basis:** the supplied `de.md` proficiency guide in `languages.zip`. Its language-system inventories, eight milestone groupings, endpoint distinctions, and stated coverage landmarks are the basis for this document. The original attachment is not required to use this self-contained authoring guide.

**Authoring adaptations:** sentence briefs, focused-target rules, JSON design examples, coverage mapping, and editorial acceptance requirements implement the Meiki project’s card interaction. They are not official examination criteria or claims that the supplied proficiency guide specified this exact card format. Project production choices and English support are explicit in Sections 2–4 and 11. The exact stage counts and stage splits in Section 4.1 are explicit project production allocations, not official examination quotas or measured optimal learning quantities. Where the curriculum does not enumerate every lexical item, develop that inventory transparently within the fixed allocation; do not reduce the count or silently replace the curriculum.

| Supplied guide sections | Authoring treatment |
|---|---|
| 1–3: goal, variety, framework | Retained as production scope, recognition boundaries, and limits on proficiency claims. |
| 4–5: diagnosis and essential systems | Converted to prerequisite analysis and sentence-selection requirements. |
| 6: eight milestone inventories | Knowledge topics and endpoint distinctions retained; learner comprehension/production tasks become sentence briefs and focused targets. |
| 7–11: sound, listening, reading, grammar, vocabulary | Converted to sentence composition, cloze design, annotations, and later audio requirements. |
| 12–13: interaction, feedback, writing | Converted to social-context and editorial checks, not tutor or learner assignments. |
| 14: assessment | Replaced with content acceptance evidence; no learner performance certification is claimed. |
| 15–16: resources and failures | Kept as reference roles and card-rejection/repair criteria, without purchasing or study schedules. |
| 17: source notes | Replaced by this self-contained basis and adaptation record; no absent chat or earlier guide is required. |

**Reference boundary:** external links are carried from the supplied material for traceability; this conversion did not revalidate their content or current availability. Verify uncertain linguistic claims before production. No model/runtime installation, audio generation, or publication is authorized by a reference list.
